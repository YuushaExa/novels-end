      "title": "Chapter 1: Terror is Coming",
      "content": "In Jiangyin City, a bar was filled with the smell of cigarettes and alcohol, and the noise and the sounds of men and women playing were mixed together.\r\n Among the group of people, there were three young men with colorful hair who seemed to be looking for "prey" and scanned the bar to see if there was anyone alone. \r\n At this time, a woman holding a wine glass with a blurred look attracted their attention. \r\n The woman was wearing a topless dress, highlighting her curvy figure. Her long legs as white as snow were swaying on the other leg, as if teasing the heartstrings of passers-by. \r\n "It can be seen that she has suffered emotional setbacks. This is a good opportunity for us to take action." \r\n One of the young men with dyed yellow hair licked his lips and showed a lewd expression. \r\n The three looked at each other and walked towards the woman. \r\n "Is the beauty alone?" The young man with dyed yellow hair spoke first, and as he spoke, he tentatively put his hand on the woman's shoulder. \r\n The woman drank the wine in the glass in one gulp without any surprise. Her cheeks flushed,\r\n her eyes were blurred and charming, and she said in a teasing voice: "Little brother, do you want to accompany me?"\r\n She licked her red lips with her tongue, and gently lifted the chin of the yellow-haired young man with her fingers. \r\n The yellow-haired young man was tickled by the charming woman in front of him, and he took the opportunity to hug the woman's waist. \r\n "Then accompany us brothers to find a place to play?" The yellow-haired young man pointed to the two people behind him, and the two people behind him had already revealed hungry wolf eyes. \r\n "I'll take you to find a good place." The woman bit her red lips as she said that, and the more seductive eyes made the hearts of several people beat straight. \r\n After that, the woman put down the wine glass and took the yellow-haired young man's hand and walked towards the back door of the bar, and the other two followed closely. \r\n The three young men had already been hooked by the woman and followed her to the back alley of the bar. \r\n There were no street lights in the back alley at night, and no one would pass by here. The road could only be seen by the moonlight. \r\n When she came to the depths of the alley, the woman stopped, then turned around and pressed against the chest of the yellow-haired young man, stroking the young man's heart with her hand. \r\n "My little brother's heart beats so fast, I like it even more." \r\n As soon as the woman's charming voice fell, the young man's eyes suddenly widened, and his mouth seemed to be blocked by something. He wanted to shout but couldn't make a sound. \r\n The woman's hand was inserted directly into the heart of the yellow-haired young man like an iron claw, and she took out a heart that was still connected to the aorta. \r\n The two people following behind didn't know what was going on at this time, and they were still thinking about going forward to continue what they were going to do. \r\n At this time, the yellow-haired young man fell straight in front of them. \r\n The two young men who were about to step forward were stunned for a moment, and then looked up, only to see that the woman had a hideous face, her eyeballs had all turned black, and the skin on her face had long lost the whiteness of jade just now. Her wrinkled face looked like an old lady in her eighties, without a trace of blood. \r\n Holding the heart that was still dripping with blood in her hand, she gently bit it with her mouthful of sharp teeth. \r\n "Well~ Not bad" \r\n She chuckled and looked at the two young men in front of her. \r\n "Ah~ And you two, I don't know how it tastes." The ghost woman's voice had long lost its charm, only a hoarse and unpleasant voice. \r\n The two young men saw the horrific scene in front of them and were about to turn around and run away. \r\n A pair of black claws instantly strangled the back of the necks of the two men. The claws suddenly exerted force upwards, and the two heads connected to the cervical vertebrae were directly pulled out, leaving only two headless corpses falling heavily. \r\n The old female ghost looked at the two heads in her hand carefully as if she was looking at a trophy. There was only fear in the eyes of the two heads. \r\n "Hehe, little brother is so cute." A hoarse and unpleasant voice came from the wrinkled female ghost. \r\n Then the female ghost opened her bloody mouth and swallowed the two heads one by one. \r\n "Interrupt urgent news. A major criminal case occurred in the early morning of last night. Three men were brutally killed. There have been frequent murders in the city recently. I hope that the general public will try to reduce travel at night." \r\n Li Ye, lying on the sofa, looked at the news on a certain audio on his mobile phone and sighed, thinking: "These things have been happening all the time in the past few days. Alas, this terrible world." \r\n Li Ye is a junior student at a university in Jiangyin City. He studies alone in Jiangyin City without background and resources. The tuition fee is all spent on his part-time job and the support of relatives. \r\n In this cheap rental house, the items are placed in a mess but not dirty, and there is order in the chaos. \r\n "Why hasn't the takeaway arrived yet?" Li Ye looked at the takeaway information on his phone and looked at the dark night outside. \r\n Just as he was about to call to urge the order, there was a knock on the door outside. "Dong Dong Dong"\r\n The sudden knock on the door startled Li Ye and he looked at the door. "The takeaway has arrived? Why didn't you call?"\r\n He looked at his phone in confusion and walked towards the door. Just as he was about to turn the doorknob to open the door, the knock on the door outside became louder and louder, as if someone was hitting the door with their head. \r\n "Bang Bang Bang"\r\n The sound became louder and louder, and Li Ye felt something was wrong at this time, and stopped the action in his hand in time. \r\n "Fuck, what is that?" He rolled his Adam's apple and swallowed his saliva, then lay on the cat's eye and looked out. This closer look almost scared him to scream. \r\n I saw the takeaway man standing outside the house, covered in blood, his whole head seemed to have been run over by a car, and became twisted. \r\n Blood was flowing from the severely deformed mouth, and the mouth opened slightly to make a low and strange sound. \r\n "Your takeaway has arrived, open the door quickly." \r\n Hearing this strange voice, Li Ye was immediately startled and broke out in a cold sweat. He quickly took out his mobile phone to call the police. \r\n "Call the police, call the police." Both hands opened the dial button in a panic. \r\n What made him desperate was that the mobile phone had no signal at all at this time. \r\n "Why is there no signal suddenly?" At this time, Li Ye's heartbeat accelerated, and the sweat on his forehead kept dripping on the phone. \r\n The noise outside the door was getting louder and louder, and the door of this cheap rental house would soon be knocked open. \r\n In this small rental house, there was no place to hide. \r\n A loud noise was heard, the door of the rental house was knocked open, and a foul smell instantly poured into Li Ye's nasal cavity. I saw the ghost in the takeaway uniform carrying a bag of lunch boxes walking towards him. \r\n "The takeaway has arrived, eat, eat." The extremely weird voice came out of the twisted mouth. Li Ye got goose bumps all over his body and leaned against the wall, watching the scene with horror. \r\n "I don't want to die, I'm still a virgin." Li Ye wanted to cry but had no tears at this moment. He hadn't experienced the beauty of the world yet. Is it going to end now? \r\n Just when he was in deep despair, a group of white light rushed in from the window and blocked Li Ye's way. \r\n The ghost was obviously stunned when he saw this scene, and then stopped. \r\n "Hehe, it's just a residual soul." The ghost chuckled coldly, and then the whole body exuded black air, and the pungent smell became stronger. \r\n A pair of black claws stabbed directly at the white light. The white light did not dodge, but emitted a more fierce breath to scatter the black claws. \r\n At this moment, the ghost was startled, and after realizing something was wrong, it turned around and tried to escape. \r\n But the white light could not let it escape. The white breath instantly enveloped the entire rental house, and the pungent and rotten smell just now gradually dissipated. \r\n As soon as the ghost's miserable howl sounded, the ghost's figure dissipated like dust.

      "content": "Seeing the ghost being destroyed in an instant, Li Ye, who was standing behind the white light, opened his mouth halfway and looked at all this in disbelief.\r\n At this time, the white light gradually dissipated, and a graceful figure slowly emerged.\r\n Wearing a white long dress in ancient style, her ink-like hair naturally draped over her back, and a moving fragrance filled the rental house.\r\n The woman in white slowly turned around at this time, and a stunning face appeared in front of Li Ye. A smile appeared at the corner of her mouth, and a pair of beautiful eyes looked at him with a smile.\r\n Li Ye had already been stunned at this time. This smile seemed to be able to heal people's psychology, and the fear just now disappeared instantly.\r\n The woman in white looked at Li Ye's dazed look and covered her mouth with her hands and chuckled softly, her voice was light and pleasant. Then she turned into a wisp of white mist and approached his chest.\r\n Li Ye subconsciously raised his arm to block it, but the white mist condensed into a white jade pendant hanging on his chest after it approached his chest. \r\n "This is..." Seeing a jade pendant suddenly hanging on his neck, Li Ye was immediately confused. \r\n With doubts, Li Ye was about to reach out to touch the jade pendant. The jade pendant felt delicate and cold, and it felt heavy in the palm of his hand. \r\n "Are you in the jade pendant?" Li Ye asked doubtfully while touching the jade pendant. \r\n At this time, the jade pendant flashed with white light, and then a light and pleasant voice sounded in Li Ye's mind. \r\n "Yes, just now I consumed too much spiritual power to eliminate that ghost." \r\n At this point, the woman's voice stopped abruptly. \r\n "What's wrong?" The voice suddenly stopped, and Li Ye asked hurriedly. \r\n At this time, the white light emitted by the jade pendant had disappeared. Li Ye looked at the jade pendant on his chest in confusion, and then said silently: "Husband? Slave? Or an ancient ghost."\r\n At this time, Li Ye suddenly saw a line of blood words in his eyes, which clearly wrote his personal information. He rubbed his eyes, but the blood words in front of him did not disappear. \r\n "Name: Li Ye\r\n Age: 20 years old\r\n Constitution: Kidney deficiency\r\n "\r\n "Kidney... Kidney deficiency?" When Li Ye saw the evaluation of himself on this information board, his brows were frowned and his face flushed, and then he touched his lower back. \r\n "Companion ghost: \r\n Thousand-year demon soul (residual soul) \r\n Attached token: Blood Spirit Jade Pendant \r\n Taoism cultivation: unknown" \r\n "Essence blood can restore the spiritual power of the companion ghost, and the essence blood can be dripped into the Blood Spirit Jade Pendant to complete the bond binding." \r\n Looking at the blood words in front of him, Li Ye began to think. \r\n "Thousand-year demon soul, why is there a residual soul behind it? Taoism cultivation is unknown," \r\n Thinking of this, Li Ye couldn't help shaking his head and laughing. How could this kind of Liao Zhai-style plot happen to him? \r\n Originally, Li Ye didn't believe that there were ghosts in this world, but after what happened tonight, he had to believe it even if he didn't believe it. \r\n "It seems that this world is going to change." Li Ye looked out the window, thinking that he could kill demons and save the world in the future, so he couldn't help but smile. \r\n Just when he was immersed in his imagination in the future, he suddenly thought of something and immediately turned around and ran out the door. \r\n When the ghost knocked on the door just now, the whole door was directly removed. "It's over, it's over. If the landlord knows about this, he will blackmail me severely."\r\n Looking at the shabby door lying on the ground, Li Ye's excitement just now disappeared instantly, and he opened his mobile phone with a sad face to check his balance. \r\n "There are more than two thousand left. I don't know how much he will ask me for."\r\n Sighed, and then looked at the corridor outside the house. \r\n "There was no one who noticed such a big noise. It seems that the woman should not have come back yet."\r\n Retracted his head, and then lifted the shabby wooden door and leaned it against the door. \r\n "Let's do this tonight. Anyway, there is nothing in the house that thieves want."\r\n Patted the dust in his palm, and looked at the time on his mobile phone. It was already three o'clock in the morning. \r\n At this time, sleepiness gradually came, and Li Ye yawned while walking towards his bed. \r\n The reason why no one noticed the loud noise just now was because Li Ye lived in the suburbs. The rental house was old and dilapidated. Only the extremely poor would live here. \r\n Li Ye lived on the floor with only him, a woman working in a bar, and a painter with strange behavior. \r\n Lying on his small bed, Li Ye looked at the jade pendant carefully. \r\n "You can bind with the demon soul with blood essence, give it a try." \r\n As he said, Li Ye found a knife on the table beside the bed, held the knife in his right hand and looked at his left finger. \r\n He took a deep breath, and the tip of the knife slowly approached the middle finger. \r\n Li Ye gritted his teeth and exerted force with his right hand. \r\n "Hiss~" \r\n The bright red hot blood flowed down his fingers, and Li Ye quickly dripped the blood on the jade pendant. \r\n At the moment when the blood dripped on the jade pendant, the drop of blood seemed to disappear and merge into the jade pendant. \r\n "That should be enough, go to sleep."\r\n After these operations, Li Ye put the jade pendant on the table beside the bed, and then fell asleep. \r\n After finally finding a comfortable sleeping position, Li Ye suddenly felt his fingers wet. \r\n He frowned and slowly opened his eyes, and found that it was the demon soul who had just saved him squatting beside his bed holding his cut finger. \r\n Seeing this scene, Li Ye was just slightly startled and did not react much. \r\n He knew that this demon soul would not harm him, not to mention that he had just bound to this demon soul. \r\n The demon soul found that Li Ye had woken up, stared at her, quickly stopped his behavior, and a trace of red appeared on his face. \r\n "The slave did not mean to disturb my husband's rest, but I recovered my spiritual power and couldn't bear my husband to get hurt." The demon soul glanced to the side with a shy expression, and his voice was soft like\r\n At this time, Li Ye found that his finger was affected by the demon soul, and the wound healed quickly. \r\n Li Ye got up and sat on the bed, looking at the rapidly healing finger. \r\n "Amazing." He said with a smile and glanced at the demon soul. \r\n "By the way, what's your name, why do you call me husband?" \r\n Li Ye gestured to the demon soul squatting beside the bed to sit down. \r\n A hint of darkness flashed across the demon soul's face, and then he smiled and said softly: "My name is Lingyun, a fox demon demon soul. I like to call you husband." \r\n Hearing this answer, Li Ye didn't say much. Then he said: "Hello, my name is Li Ye." \r\n "Now I'm called Li Ye." Lingyun lowered his head and muttered to himself. \r\n Looking at Lingyun's thoughtful look, Li Ye couldn't help asking: "What's wrong?" \r\n "It's okay, husband, take a rest, I won't disturb you." Lingyun said with a smile, and then turned into a ray of white light and merged into the jade pendant. "

      "title": "Chapter 3 Discovering Ghostly Aura",
      "content": "Just when Li Ye and the demon soul completed the bond, another line of blood words appeared in front of him.\r\n "Obtain the psychic eye, the art of drawing talismans in mid-air."\r\n Looking at the floating information board in front of him, Li Ye felt a chill in his eyes, and it seemed that a warm current was instilled in his body flowing through the veins of his body. \r\n "Drawing talismans in mid-air, what are you drawing?" Li Ye looked at the blood words in front of him and was very confused. \r\n Without thinking about it anymore, Li Ye closed his eyes and began to use the psychic eye to look out according to the instructions of the blood words. \r\n And when he saw it, the scene in front of him made him tremble all over. I saw countless ghosts wandering around under the dim lights of the city. But most of these ghosts are unconscious and pose no threat to ordinary people. \r\n "Is the underworld collapsed? So many ghosts are wandering in the world." Seeing the densely packed ghosts in front of him, Li Ye felt his scalp tingling and immediately closed his psychic eyes. \r\n "Anyway, I have the ability to protect myself now. Sleep is the most important thing in the world." Thinking to himself, Li Ye fell asleep. \r\n The jade pendant flashed and Lingyun, who was wearing a white dress, stood by the bed and looked at Li Ye silently. \r\n "You are so brave. You can sleep so peacefully even without the door." Then he waved his sleeves and put down a ban at the door. \r\n Then he sat down on the bed with light steps, looking at him with a gentle smile on his face. \r\n The sky gradually brightened, and the whole city was no longer oppressive at night. The sunlight disc player dispersed the darkness in every corner of the city. \r\n "Who did it? Who did it?" A huge shout woke Li Ye up instantly. \r\n He rubbed his eyes and quickly got dressed and got out of bed. \r\n "Ah~ What's coming is still coming." He sighed in his heart and walked out the door. \r\n I saw a middle-aged greasy uncle standing at the door of Li Ye's rental house, looking at him with a gloomy face, and then he said: \r\n "Good boy, my house is ruined by you like this?" \r\n Li Ye put on a helpless expression. He couldn't say that it was damaged by the ghosts last night. If he really said that, the landlord would definitely say that the ghosts had nothing to do and came to damage your door? \r\n "How much money do you want to pay, I will pay." Li Ye turned on his mobile phone and prepared to scan the code to pay. \r\n "Wait a minute, I'm going to go inside to see, who knows what else I've broken." The landlord pushed Li Ye away with one hand and walked in. \r\n Walking into the rental house, a fragrance came to my nose. The landlord looked at Li Ye with doubt on his face and thought: \r\n "Did this guy bring a woman here last night? The door was broken, he's pretty fierce." \r\n The house, which was already shabby and exuded a faint smell of decay, suddenly had an intoxicating fragrance, which was hard not to make associations. \r\n After checking the house, the jade pendant on the table caught the landlord's attention. \r\n He walked up and picked up the jade pendant and looked at it carefully. \r\n "Hey, don't touch my things." Li Ye saw the landlord pick up his jade pendant, and he quickly rushed forward to grab it back. \r\n The landlord subconsciously looked at Li Ye, and at this time the jade pendant flashed white light, and a fierce burning sensation came from the landlord's hand. \r\n "Ouch" cried softly, and the jade pendant broke away from his hand. Li Ye quickly stepped forward to catch the jade pendant and hurriedly hung it close to his chest. \r\n Looking at his red palm, the landlord frowned and looked at Li Ye. \r\n "What is this? It's a rare thing. But where did you, a poor student, get this jade pendant?" \r\n Facing the landlord's questioning, Li Ye smiled and said: \r\n "It's just a street stall product, I bought it for fun. I will pay as much as I should for this door." \r\n "Okay, then pay one thousand." The landlord shook his red hand and said. \r\n "A broken door actually asked me one thousand, why didn't he just rob it." Li Ye greeted the landlord in his heart. \r\n "It's a bit expensive, this door is broken." Before Li Ye finished speaking, the landlord said lightly: \r\n "You don't have to pay, go live somewhere else, this is the cheapest rental house in Jiangyin City. If you really can't afford it, then use your jade pendant to pay it." \r\n Li Ye tried his best to control his emotions, because it would be of no benefit to him to completely turn against this landlord now, and what he said was also true. The rent of other places is nothing compared to one thousand yuan. \r\n "One thousand is one thousand," Li Ye said with his back teeth. \r\n After that, Li Ye took out his mobile phone and paid one thousand yuan. At this time, the landlord showed a smug smile and said, "Don't worry, I'll find a door for you today, so you won't be cold." Then he waved and walked out of the rental house. \r\n Seeing the landlord walking away, Li Ye secretly swore in his heart that he must buy his own house in Jiangyin City. \r\n At this time, a cell phone ring interrupted his thoughts. He pressed the answer button and heard a loud voice from the phone: "Hello, Li Ye, do you want to go to the bar tonight?"\r\n This person is Li Ye's college roommate, named Chen Liang. He has a good family background and is playful by nature. He plans to have some fun during the summer vacation. \r\n "Didn't you see the news yesterday? There have been strange things happening these days."\r\n "It's okay, it's not a big problem. Let's go to Linghai Bar,"\r\n Just when Li Ye was about to reject Chen Liang's proposal, a line of blood words appeared in front of Li Ye again. \r\n "Go to Linghai Bar tonight and kill the Painted Skin Ghost."\r\n Seeing this line of blood words, Li Ye no longer hesitated, "Okay, pick me up tonight."\r\n Putting away the phone, Li Ye took out the jade pendant hanging on his chest. \r\n "It's up to you tonight."\r\n The jade pendant flashed twice as if in response. \r\n Soon it was night, Chen Liang drove to where Li Ye lived, and Li Ye had been waiting downstairs for a long time. \r\n "Get in the car, there are people waiting over there." Chen Liang said and waved to Li Ye to get in the car. \r\n After getting in the car, Chen Liang stepped on the accelerator, and the engine roared. \r\n "Is my new car powerful?" Chen Liang said with a proud smile. \r\n "Slow down." \r\n The two drove from the sparsely lit suburbs to the bustling city center. Leaning against the car window, Li Ye looked at the sky shrouded in darkness in the distance, and felt a little panic in his heart, but this strange feeling was soon dispelled by the warmth from the jade pendant. \r\n Gradually, the surrounding buildings became more and more new, with tall buildings standing in rows. Even at 12 o'clock in the morning, the lights of the city were still awake. \r\n Soon they arrived at the door of the bar, and the two opened the door and got out of the car. There were three men and two women standing at the door of the bar. A young man dressed in fashionable clothes saw Chen Liang and hurriedly said: \r\n "Why are you here so late? Come in quickly." The young man said and walked in with the woman next to him who was wearing revealing clothes. \r\n Chen Liang gestured to Li Ye, and the two walked into the bar. \r\n This was Li Ye's first time to such a place. There was noisy and rhythmic music, and women in revealing clothes were dancing hotly. \r\n As a country bumpkin, Li Ye had never seen this scene, and his face suddenly became slightly hot. \r\n Chen Liang patted Li Ye on the shoulder and said, "Relax, buddy is taking you to see the world today." After that, he took Li Ye to the three men and two women in front. \r\n Then the group sat in the reserved seats, and at this time, Lingyun's voice sounded in Li Ye's mind. \r\n "Husband, I sense a ghost here."\r\n "Ghost?" Hearing Lingyun's words, Li Ye looked around. \r\n Lingyun then said: "Well, I'm afraid there are ghosts here in the form of ordinary people." "

      "title": "Chapter 4 Painted Skin Ghost",
      "content": "Hearing Lingyun's reminder, Li Ye immediately opened his psychic eyes and looked around.\r\n Just as Li Ye was concentrating on observing, Chen Liang called Li Ye.\r\n "Hey, which beauty have you taken a fancy to? You are so absorbed in looking at her."\r\n Li Ye subconsciously looked at Chen Liang, looking embarrassed. \r\n At this time, a long-haired beauty in a short skirt holding hands beside Chen Liang attracted Li Ye's attention. In Li Ye's opinion, the long-haired woman actually exuded a faint black aura. \r\n This made Li Ye's face change immediately, and he looked at the woman with a vigilant face. \r\n Chen Liang looked at Li Ye's expression and whispered in his ear: "What's the trick? Do you like this? I'll give it to you later."\r\n Li Ye smiled awkwardly when he heard this and said, "Then I'll trouble you, brother."\r\n "You are usually serious, but I didn't expect that you would reveal your true nature the first time you came to this place." Chen Liang said to Li Ye with a chuckle. \r\n Then he patted Li Ye's shoulder and walked to the long-haired woman and whispered something, making the long-haired woman laugh and look at Li Ye from time to time. \r\n Li Ye smiled and nodded in response to the long-haired woman, and then complained in his heart: "Good brother, I am helping you, otherwise you will be sucked dry by this female ghost." \r\n At this time, the long-haired woman twisted her graceful waist and walked towards Li Ye. \r\n "Lingyun, is this it? Will she find you?" Li Ye said to Lingyun in his mind. \r\n "Well, that's it, don't worry she won't find it. She should take you to a place where no one is." \r\n The long-haired woman sat next to Li Ye and leaned on Li Ye's body. \r\n Looking at the gully formed by the white bun next to him, Li Ye couldn't help but take a deep breath and coughed twice. \r\n The woman looked at Li Ye with an uncomfortable look and chuckled and said, "Is the little brother still a virgin?"\r\n The woman could guess from Li Ye's expression, and then she used her fingers to tease Li Ye's face twice and said:\r\n "That's even better, little brother, how about my sister take you to a good place later?"\r\n Li Ye didn't know how to answer at this time. Thinking back to the way Chen Liang chatted with the woman, he pretended to say, "Okay, then I'll trouble you, sister."\r\n Then he slowly hugged the woman's waist.\r\n "Hmph, I'll kill you in a while." At this time, Lingyun's angry voice sounded in Li Ye's mind.\r\n After a while, he followed the woman to the alley behind the bar where no one was, where there was only a faint light.\r\n The woman stopped and lay on Li Ye's chest, and a pair of slender hands stroked Li Ye's chest from top to bottom. \r\n At this time, a pair of slender white jade hands suddenly turned into sharp claws covered with spikes. Just when the female ghost was about to pierce Li Ye's heart, the jade pendant on Li Ye's chest emitted a white light wave, instantly burning the female ghost's claws. \r\n The female ghost had no time to react, and quickly retreated with a howl. \r\n A ray of white light slowly dispersed from the jade pendant at this time, and Lingyun, who was wearing a white dress, slowly condensed beside Li Ye. \r\n The long-haired female ghost who was plotted against completely revealed her true appearance at this moment, exuding black air all over her body, and a pair of eyes without whites looked at Lingyun viciously. \r\n "Humph, a mere remnant soul dared to plot against me, I will beat you to death." After saying that, the female ghost floated up, and the surrounding was suddenly surrounded by black air. Instantly, a ball of black air condensed and shot towards Lingyun. \r\n At this time, Lingyun stood in front of Li Ye, frowning slightly, waving his sleeves, and a great demonic power shattered the black gas. \r\n Then Lingyun's figure flashed and flew into the air, and instantly came behind the female ghost. With his hands, he condensed a long sword formed by a white shadow and stabbed it at the back of the female ghost. \r\n The female ghost was shocked at first, but she reacted quickly and turned around to block Lingyun's long sword with her black claws. \r\n But the long sword was so powerful that it shocked the female ghost back several meters away. \r\n Lingyun did not give the female ghost any chance to breathe, and then stabbed at the female ghost with a sword. \r\n The long sword condensed by the white shadow exuded a spiritual breath. The female ghost looked at Lingyun with fear, and did not dare to confront it head-on. She could only dodge like a ghost. \r\n Facing the ghost's flexible evasion, Lingyun held the long sword and rotated in place, and a circle of white sword energy surged around. \r\n A scream sounded, and one of the ghost's arms was directly cut off by the sword energy, and the broken arm fell to the ground with black air. \r\n The ghost covered her wound with black air. The ghost now understood that this was not an ordinary residual soul in front of her, and looked at Lingyun with fear. \r\n "It is the villain who has no eyes to recognize the mountain, and offended you. I only ask you to let me go. You and I are ghosts, why should we help humans, we are the same kind." At this moment, the ghost begged for mercy, and her voice was crying. \r\n Lingyun's face was as cold as frost at this time, and he looked at her coldly. \r\n Without hesitating for a moment, the hand holding the sword exerted force, and the spiritual power suddenly surged, and chopped directly at the ghost's head. \r\n The ghost girl realized that her plea for mercy would not work, so she snorted coldly and said in a low voice: "You forced me to do this. Let's all die together."\r\n After that, the ghost girl's face was covered with black blood vessels, and then it turned blood red in an instant. Her eyes were filled with blood red, and then she let out a tragic roar. \r\n "Let's die together!" The ghost girl's roar spread all around. \r\n Lingyun saw that something was wrong, so he quickly stopped and turned to float towards Li Ye. He came to Li Ye and quickly formed a protective shield composed of spiritual power to protect himself and Li Ye. \r\n At this time, the ghost girl's body exuded blood-colored mist from the inside out. The blood-colored mist became thicker and thicker. With a burst of sound, the ghost girl's body burst out. The blood mist instantly formed spikes that spread out densely around. \r\n Under Lingyun's gathered protective shield, the blood-colored spikes were blocked one by one. But at this time, Lingyun's face began to feel a little tired. Fortunately, there were not many blood-colored spikes. \r\n Soon, all the spikes dissipated. Lingyun finally couldn't hold on at this moment. He fell back, and Li Ye hurriedly lifted him up and held him in his arms. \r\n "Lingyun, what's wrong with you?" Li Ye asked with concern. \r\n Lingyun was pale at this moment, and her expression looked very weak. \r\n "I'm fine, just a little tired." Lingyun's weak voice just fell, and then her body turned into a white light and drilled into the jade pendant again. \r\n Li Ye's face was filled with worry at this time, and he looked at the place where the female ghost exploded again. At this time, there was only a pool of thick black liquid in that place. What Li Ye didn't notice was that the pool of black liquid melted into a drop of pure black water and quietly merged into Li Ye's body. \r\n "Tsk tsk tsk, if you have a wife like this, what else can a husband ask for?" A magnetic and youthful voice sounded in Li Ye's ears. \r\n "Who, who is talking." Li Ye looked around vigilantly. \r\n "Boy, stop looking around, I'm in your body." The voice sounded again. \r\n Hearing the voice saying that he was in his body, Li Ye suddenly became nervous, "In my body? Who are you, a demon or a ghost." \r\n "Hey, boy, how can you talk like that, I am... Forget it, I won't talk to you for now, or quickly restore your wife's spiritual power. Although the dying blow of the Painted Skin Ghost is not fatal, it still has a lot of harm to the demon soul." \r\n At this time, Li Ye remembered the reminder given to him by the blood word, and using his own blood can help the demon soul restore its spiritual power. \r\n "I'll help you recover right away." Li Ye said softly to Lingyun in the jade pendant, his eyes full of determination. "

      "content": "Thinking of this, Li Ye turned and ran into the bar.\r\n At this moment, in the darkness of the alley behind the bar, a middle-aged man in black clothes with an obvious burn on his face was silently watching Li Ye.\r\n "Chen Liang, do you have a knife?" Li Ye asked anxiously, with an anxious look on his face. \r\n "No way, it's over so soon? Where's the woman?" Chen Liang said with a puzzled look. \r\n "Hurry, I need it urgently." At this time, Li Ye did not dare to delay. He just wanted to know whether Lingyun was okay. \r\n "Don't worry, don't worry, I have it." As he said, Chen Liang took out a folding knife from his trouser pocket. \r\n Li Ye didn't say much and took it from Chen Liang. \r\n "Thank you, you play first, I'll be there in a while." After talking to Chen Liang, Li Ye turned around and ran quickly to the toilet cubicle. \r\n Chen Liang shook his head and smiled and said silently: "Really, it's still so strange." Then he continued to hold the wine glass and look for beautiful women to chat up. \r\n Came to the bathroom, locked the cubicle door, and took out the jade pendant on his chest. \r\n "Lingyun? Lingyun" Li Ye first called Lingyun softly, but the jade pendant did not respond. \r\n Then Li Ye held the jade pendant in his left hand and slashed towards his palm with a folding knife in his right hand. \r\n It's important to have a back molar, and Li Ye's brows are wrinkled at this moment. \r\n I saw a cut of about one centimeter on Li Ye's palm, and blood immediately gushed out and merged into the jade pendant. \r\n At this time, the jade pendant seemed to have a huge attraction, and the blood from Li Ye's wound was sucked into the jade pendant. \r\n "Hiss~" Li Ye felt a pain at this time, and sweat had already appeared on his forehead, but he still gritted his teeth and did not stop the jade pendant from sucking blood. \r\n After more than ten seconds, the jade pendant finally stopped absorbing blood, and Li Ye breathed a sigh of relief. \r\n "Lingyun, are you feeling better?" Li Ye called softly again. \r\n At this time, the jade pendant once again glowed white, followed by Lingyun's soft and weak voice: \r\n "Well, thank you, sir. I'm going to sleep for a while." \r\n "I'm glad you're okay, you have a good rest." \r\n As soon as Lingyun finished speaking, a subtle white light floated towards Li Ye's wound. Li Ye immediately felt a coolness coming from the wound, and then the wound stopped bleeding, and the wound cracks also showed a tendency to heal. \r\n Li Ye looked at his wound in surprise, then touched the jade pendant and thought, "Why are you so good to me? I won't let you attack rashly without being absolutely sure in the future. I have to quickly acquire a certain level of strength."\r\n "Ah~ I didn't expect to eat dog food just after waking up." The boy in the body said dejectedly.\r\n At this time, Li Ye asked the man in his body, "Did you write the blood words I can see?"\r\n "Oh, you're not stupid, it's me."\r\n "I don't care what your purpose is. Since you can give me the ability to draw talismans in the air and the ability to have psychic eyes, you must need me too, and I only have one need."\r\n "Yeah, yeah, yeah, you say and I'll listen."\r\n "Make me stronger." Li Ye said in a firm tone. \r\n "I can make you stronger, but you have to help me complete a few things in exchange."\r\n "As long as you don't do anything that hurts the world, I promise you."\r\n "Don't worry, I am very principled. I haven't thought about it yet. When you go home, I will give you something good."\r\n After talking with his body, Li Ye left the bathroom. \r\n At this time, Chen Liang was chatting with a beautiful woman in revealing clothes, but the beautiful woman seemed to be angry and splashed the wine on Chen Liang's face, then picked up her handbag and left. \r\n Li Ye, who was standing not far from Chen Liang, was embarrassed when he saw this scene. He was about to call him but stopped talking at this time. \r\n Chen Liang closed his eyes and wiped the wine on his face with his hands, staring fiercely at the direction where the woman left. \r\n "Hmph, if you don't want to go, then don't go. Why are you pretending?"\r\n At this time, Chen Liang found Li Ye standing behind him, and looked at Li Ye with a squinting look and said, "Are you comfortable today?"\r\n "Uh... OK, OK." Li Ye smiled awkwardly. \r\n As he said that, Chen Liang drank the wine in the glass in one gulp. \r\n "Okay, then today is half of the goal, and I won't play at home." After stretching, Chen Liang put his arm on Li Ye's neck and walked out. \r\n "Here's the knife." Li Ye handed the folding knife to Chen Liang. \r\n "Since you are so anxious to use it, I'll give it to you." After saying that, Chen Liang started the car and left the door of the bar with a foot on the accelerator. \r\n Soon Chen Liang sent Li Ye to the door of his house, \r\n "Today's mission is not good, let's make an appointment another day." After saying that, he drove away. \r\n Li Ye smiled and shook his head, then returned home. \r\n "Husband, go back quickly. I feel something nearby." Lingyun's voice came into Li Ye's mind at this time. \r\n Li Ye did not doubt Lingyun's words at all, and immediately quickened his pace and ran back home. \r\n "What was nearby just now?" Li Ye asked nervously. \r\n Along with Lingyun's pleasant laughter, a white light came out from the jade pendant, and Lingyun's graceful figure slowly emerged. \r\n At this moment, she was covering her mouth and laughing softly, saying, "I'm just teasing my husband. There are only some lonely ghosts nearby." \r\n Hearing Lingyun's words, Li Ye's expression suddenly became embarrassed. \r\n "It's good that there is nothing. You just recovered not long ago. If there is, I'm really worried." Li Ye said with a sigh of relief. \r\n "Husband, how is your hand." Lingyun walked forward slowly, pulled up Li Ye's injured hand and looked at it. \r\n "It's okay, I'm almost done. By the way, I have a question for you."\r\n After that, Li Ye pulled Lingyun to sit on the bed. Lingyun sat with her hands on her legs, looking at Li Ye tenderly. \r\n "Just ask, sir." Lingyun said. \r\n Li Ye scratched his head and thought, then said, "Emm... Did we know each other before?"\r\n Hearing Li Ye's question, Lingyun was obviously stunned for a moment, and his eyes dodged and looked at the ground. \r\n "Otherwise, why did you save me that night." Li Ye said immediately. \r\n "My wife... I knew my husband a long time ago. But there are some things I can't say now." Lingyun bit her lips lightly and held the hem of her skirt tightly with both hands. \r\n Li Ye saw Lingyun's embarrassment and didn't ask any more questions. \r\n He just smiled and said, "It's okay, I just asked. It's getting late, I'll go to bed later."\r\n "Well, husband, go to bed early." Lingyun nodded slightly, and then turned into a wisp of white breath and drilled into the jade pendant. \r\n "It seems that Lingyun and I must have some origins, otherwise why would you call me husband."\r\n After thinking about it, Li Ye asked the man in his body, "Hey, what do you want to give me?"\r\n "Damn, can you stop calling me hey all the time and call me Taoist Ghost Master."\r\n Li Ye suddenly became helpless and had to call again, "Yes, Taoist Ghost Master, what do you want to give me?"\r\n "Don't worry, I won't treat you badly."\r\n As soon as the voice fell, a small ball of blood mist floated in front of Li Ye, gradually revealing a book that exuded a faint light all over. Seeing the cover of this book, Li Ye felt that it was not an ordinary thing. \r\n "The Complete Collection of Taoist Talismans, sounds pretty impressive."\r\n Seeing the title inlaid with gold, the black cover felt very textured. Li Ye licked his fingers and couldn't wait to flip through it. \r\n Opening the book, the dazzling array of talisman names and drawing methods in the catalog appeared in front of his eyes. \r\n "The Imperial Evil-Exterminating Talisman, the Evil-Suppressing Talisman, the Five Thunder Talisman, the Fire Talisman, the Corpse-Fixing Talisman..." Li Ye silently recited the talisman types in the book. \r\n Among the many talismans in it, Li Ye only knew the Corpse-Fixing Talisman. After all, he grew up watching Lin Zhengying's zombie movies, and he was very familiar with this kind of talisman that could freeze zombies. At this time, the last part of the book caught Li Ye's attention. \r\n\r\n『Still being serialized...』\r\nFor more e-books, please visit Aixia E-books, Traditional Chinese: https://ixdzs8.tw; Simplified Chinese: https://ixdzs8.com"
