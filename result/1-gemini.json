      "content": "「Let's find a good place.」the woman said, biting her red lips, that alluring gaze making the hearts of several people pound rapidly.\nWith that said, the woman put down her wine glass and pulled the blond-haired young man's hand, walking towards the back door of the bar. The other two followed closely behind.\nThe three young men at this point had long been as if their souls were captivated, and directly followed the woman to the alley behind the bar.\nIn the alley at night, there were no streetlights, and no one would pass through here. They could only rely on moonlight to see the way.\nArriving at the deep end of the alley, the woman stopped. Then she turned around and pressed herself closely against the blond-haired young man's chest, using her hand to caress the young man's heart area.\n「Little brother, your heart is beating so fast, I like it even more.」\nAs soon as the woman's seductive words fell, the young man's eyes suddenly widened. His mouth seemed to be blocked by something; he wanted to scream but couldn't make a sound.\nOne could only see the woman's hand, like an iron claw, directly plunge into the blond-haired young man's heart area, pulling out a heart still connected to major arterial tubes.\nThe two people following behind still didn't know what was happening at this moment, and were still thinking of stepping forward to continue what they intended to do.\nAnd at this moment, the blond-haired young man fell straight down in front of their eyes.\nThe two young men who were about to step forward froze for a moment. When they looked up again, they saw the woman's face was ferocious, her eyeballs had all turned black, the skin on her face was no longer as fair as jade as it had been just now. Her wrinkled face looked like an eighty-year-old old woman, without a trace of color.\nHolding the still-dripping heart in her hand, she gently bit it with her mouth full of sharp fangs\nBit into it.\n　　\"Hmm~ not bad.\"\n　　Saying this, she chuckled lightly, looking at the two young men in front of her.\n　　\"Ah~ and you two, I wonder how you taste.\" This female ghost's voice had long lost its bewitching quality, only a hoarse, unpleasant sound remained.\n　　The two young men saw the horrifying scene before them, just as they were about to turn and run.\n　　A pair of black sharp claws instantly clamped around the back of their necks. With a fierce upward pull of those sharp claws, their two heads, still connected to their cervical spines, were directly yanked out. Only two headless corpses remained, falling heavily.\n　　This old female ghost carefully surveyed the two heads in her hands with eyes like she was looking at spoils of war. In the eyes of those two heads, there was only fear.\n　　\"Hehehe, little brothers are really cute.\" The hoarse, unpleasant voice came from the mouth of the wrinkled female ghost.\n　　Subsequently, the female ghost opened her blood-filled mouth and swallowed the two heads one by one.\n　　\"Breaking urgent news: A major criminal case occurred in the early hours of yesterday morning. Three men were brutally murdered. Homicides have been frequent in the city recently. We hope the general public will try to reduce night-time travel.\"\n　　Li Ye, lying on the sofa, watched the news on Douyin on his phone, sighed, and thought: \"These things keep happening these days. Sigh, what a terrible world.\"\n　　Li Ye was a third-year student at a university in Jiangyin City, studying alone in Jiangyin City, without background or resources. His tuition fees were entirely supported by his part-time jobs and financial aid from relatives.\n　　Inside this cheap rental house, items were placed haphazardly but not dirty or messy, amidst the chaos\nAppeared orderly.\n　　\"This delivery, why isn't it here yet?\" Li Ye looked at the delivery information on his phone, then looked at the dark night outside.\n　　Just as he was about to call to chase up the order, a knocking sound echoed from outside the house. \"Dong dong dong\"\n　　This sudden knocking sound startled Li Ye, making him look at the door. \"The delivery's here? Why didn't they call?\"\n　　He looked at his phone in confusion, then walked towards the door. Just as he was about to twist the doorknob to open the door, the knocking sound from outside grew louder, as if someone was hitting the door with their head.\n　　\"Bang bang bang\"\n　　The sound grew louder and louder. Li Ye then felt that something was wrong, and immediately stopped what he was doing.\n　　\"What the hell, what is that?\" His Adam's apple bobbed slightly as he swallowed, then he peered through the peephole. One look, and it nearly made him scream.\n　　He saw a delivery driver, covered in blood, standing outside. Their entire head seemed to have been run over by a car, becoming hideously distorted.\n　　Fresh blood flowed from their severely deformed mouth, which was slightly agape, emitting a low, eerie sound.\n　　\"Your delivery has arrived, please open the door.\"\n　　Hearing this eerie voice, Li Ye immediately broke out in a cold sweat. He quickly took out his phone, ready to call the police.\n　　\"Police, police.\" With trembling hands, he opened the dial pad.\n　　What filled him with despair was that his phone had no signal at all.\n　　\"How could there suddenly be no signal?\" At this moment, Li Ye's heart pounded faster, and sweat continuously dripped from his forehead onto his phone.\n　　The noise from outside grew increasingly\nThe louder it got, the door of this cheap rental room was about to be broken open.\n　　Inside this tiny rental room, there was simply no place to hide.\n　　A loud bang sounded, the door of the rental room was broken open, and a putrid smell instantly rushed into Li Ye's nostrils. He saw the monster wearing a delivery uniform carrying a bag of lunchboxes walking towards him.\n　　\"The delivery has arrived, eat, eat.\" An extremely eerie voice came from its twisted mouth, making Li Ye's entire body break out in goosebumps as he leaned against the wall, watching this scene with a look of horror.\n　　\"Damn, I don't want to die, I'm still a virgin!\" Li Ye was on the verge of tears at this moment, he hadn't even experienced the beauty of the world yet, was it going to end now?\n　　Just as he was feeling deep despair, a cluster of white spectral light rushed in from outside the window, blocking itself in front of Li Ye.\n　　Upon seeing this scene, the monster clearly paused, then stopped its steps.\n　　\"Hehehe, just a remnant soul.\" The monster let out a cackling sneer from its mouth, then black mist emanated from its entire body, and at this moment, the pungent smell grew even stronger.\n　　A pair of black sharp claws directly thrust towards the cluster of white light, but the white light did not dodge, instead, it only emitted an even more biting aura, scattering the black sharp claws.\n　　At this, the monster was instantly startled, and upon realizing something was wrong, it actually turned around and tried to flee.\n　　But how could that cluster of white light let it escape? The white aura instantly enveloped the entire rental room, and the pungent, putrid smell from just now gradually dissipated and vanished.\n　　Only when the monster's miserable wail had just begun to sound, its body was like dust\nLike dissipating and disappearing."

      "content": "Upon seeing that monster instantly annihilated, Li Ye, standing behind that mass of white spectral light at this moment, had his mouth half-open, watching all of this with a look of disbelief.\n　　At this moment, that mass of white spectral light gradually dissipated, and a figure with an elegant posture slowly emerged.\n　　She was wearing an ancient-style white long dress, her ink-like beautiful hair naturally draped over her back, and a captivating fragrance permeated the rental house.\n　　The white-clothed woman slowly turned around at this moment, a face capable of toppling cities and nations appeared before Li Ye. The corner of her mouth curved into a trace of a smile, and a pair of beautiful eyes, carrying a smile, looked at him.\n　　And Li Ye was already dumbfounded by the sight at this moment; this smile seemed capable of healing one's mind, and the fear from just now instantly dissipated and disappeared.\n　　Seeing Li Ye's dumbfounded appearance, that white-clothed woman then let out a light chuckle, covering her mouth, her voice light, ethereal, and pleasant to the ear. Subsequently, she transformed into a wisp of white mist and approached his chest.\n　　Li Ye subconsciously wanted to raise his arm to block, but after that mass of white mist approached his chest area, it condensed into a pure white jade pendant that hung on his chest.\n　　\"This is...\" Upon seeing a jade pendant suddenly hanging on his neck, Li Ye instantly became confused.\n　　Carrying his confusion, Li Ye was about to reach out to touch that jade pendant. The jade pendant felt delicate and ice-cold, and when placed in his palm, it had a weighty feeling.\n　　\"Are you in the jade pendant?\" Li Ye asked confusedly while touching the jade pendant.\n　　At this moment, white light flashed from the jade pendant, and immediately after, a light, ethereal, and pleasant to the ear voice rang out in Li Ye's mind.\n　　\"That's right, just now, in order to annihilate that monster, too much spiritual power was consumed.\"\nAt this point, the woman's voice came to an abrupt halt.\n　　\"What's wrong?\" The voice suddenly stopped, and Li Ye hastily asked.\n　　At this moment, the white light emitted by the jade pendant had already disappeared. Li Ye looked at the jade pendant on his chest in confusion, then muttered to himself, \"Husband? Your humble servant? Or an ancient ghost.\"\n　　Just then, Li Ye suddenly saw a line of blood-red characters in his eyes. On it, his personal information was clearly written. He rubbed his eyes, but the blood-red characters in front of him did not disappear.\n　　\"Name: Li Ye\n　　Age: 20 years old\n　　Physique: Kidney Deficiency\n　　\"\n　　\"Kid...kidney deficiency?\" When he saw this information panel's evaluation of himself, Li Ye's brows furrowed tightly, and a blush appeared on his face. Then he touched his lower back.\n　　\"Companion Ghostly Being:\n　　Thousand-Year Demonic Soul (Residual Soul)\n　　Attached Relic: Blood Spirit Jade Pendant\n　　Cultivation Level: Unknown\"\n　　\"Essence blood can make the companion ghostly being regain its spiritual power. Dropping essence blood into the blood spirit jade pendant can complete the bond binding.\"\n　　Looking at the blood-red characters in front of him, Li Ye began to ponder.\n　　\"Thousand-Year Demonic Soul, why is 'residual soul' written after it? Cultivation level unknown,\"\n　　Thinking of this, Li Ye couldn't help but shake his head and smile. How could this kind of Liaozhai-esque plot possibly happen to him?\n　　Originally, Li Ye didn't believe there were ghosts in this world, but after tonight's events, even if he didn't believe, he had to believe.\n　　\"It seems this world is about to change.\" Li Ye looked out the window. Thinking that he could slay demons and devils and save the world in the future, he couldn't help but\nA faint smile was held at the corner of the mouth.\n　　Just as he was immersed in his future aspirations, at this moment, he suddenly thought of something, and immediately turned around and ran towards the door.\n　　Just now, when the ghost monster rammed the door, the entire door was directly dislodged. \"Oh no, oh no, if the landlord finds out about this, won't he fiercely extort a good sum from me?\"\n　　Looking at this dilapidated door lying on the ground, Li Ye's excitement from just now instantly vanished, and with a worried expression, he opened his phone to check his balance.\n　　\"I still have over two thousand, I wonder how much he'll ask me for.\"\n　　He sighed, then looked towards the corridor outside the house.\n　　\"Such a big commotion happened, yet no one noticed. It seems that woman probably hasn't returned yet.\"\n　　He pulled back his outstretched head, then lifted this dilapidated wooden door and leaned it diagonally against the doorway.\n　　\"Let's just handle it this way tonight, anyway, there's nothing in the house for thieves to covet.\"\n　　He clapped the dust from his palms, and saw that the time on his phone was already three in the morning.\n　　At this moment, drowsiness gradually swept over him, and Li Ye, while yawning, walked towards his bed.\n　　The reason such a big commotion happened just now and no one noticed was because the place Li Ye lived in was in the suburbs, and this rented house was old and dilapidated to the point that, except for those who were extremely poor, no one would come to live here.\n　　On the floor Li Ye lived on, there were only him, a woman who worked at a bar, and an eccentric painter.\n　　Lying on his narrow bed, Li Ye held that jade pendant and carefully examined it.\n　　\"Using vital blood, one can complete the binding with a demon soul. Let me try.\"\nAs he spoke, Li Ye found a small knife on the table by the bed, held the knife in his right hand and looked at his left finger.\n　　Taking a deep breath, the knife tip slowly approached his middle finger.\n　　Li Ye gritted his teeth, his right hand exerted force downwards.\n　　\"Hiss~\"\n　　Bright red, scalding blood flowed down his finger, and Li Ye hurriedly dripped the blood onto the jade pendant.\n　　The moment the blood dripped onto the jade pendant, that drop of blood seemed to disappear as if merging into the jade pendant.\n　　\"This should be enough now, right? Time to sleep, time to sleep.\"\n　　After these actions, Li Ye placed the jade pendant on the table by the bed, then laid his head down and went to sleep.\n　　He had just managed to find a comfortable sleeping position, but at this moment, Li Ye suddenly felt a damp sensation on his finger.\n　　He frowned and slowly opened his eyes, discovering that it was the demon spirit that had just saved him, squatting by his bed and sucking on his cut finger.\n　　Upon seeing this scene, Li Ye was merely slightly startled, and did not react much.\n　　He knew that this demon spirit would not harm him, moreover, he had already bound himself with this demon spirit just now.\n　　This demon spirit realized that Li Ye had woken up and was staring intently at her, quickly stopped its actions, and a hint of redness appeared on its face.\n　　\"This servant did not intentionally disturb my lord's rest, it's just that I recovered my spiritual power and could not bear to see my lord injured.\" That demon spirit's eyes darted to the side, her expression becoming shy, her voice soft as\n　　At this moment, Li Ye discovered that after the demon spirit's actions on his finger, the wound had surprisingly healed quickly.\n　　Li\nYe got up and sat on the bed, looking at his rapidly healing finger.\n　　\"Amazing,\" he said with a smile, glancing at the demon spirit.\n　　\"By the way, what's your name, and why do you call me 'Xianggong'?\"\n　　Li Ye gestured with his hand for the demon spirit squatting by the bed to sit by the bed.\n　　A trace of dimness flashed across the demon spirit's face, then she smiled and said softly, \"This humble one is called Lingyun; I am a fox demon spirit. This humble one likes to call you 'Xianggong'.\"\n　　Hearing such a reply, Li Ye didn't say much. Then he said, \"Hello, my name is Li Ye.\"\n　　\"Now called Li Ye,\" Lingyun muttered to herself, lowering her head.\n　　Seeing Lingyun's pensive look, Li Ye couldn't help but ask, \"What's wrong?\"\n　　\"Nothing,\" Lingyun said with a smile, \"Xianggong, please rest. This humble one won't disturb you anymore.\" She then transformed into a wisp of white light and merged into the jade pendant."

      "title": "Chapter 3 Discover Ghostly Qi",
      "content": "At the very moment Li Ye and the demon soul completed their bond, another line of blood-red text appeared before his eyes.\n　　\"Obtained Clairvoyant Eye, Art of Drawing Talismans in Mid-Air.\"\n　　Looking at the floating information panel before his eyes, Li Ye felt a wave of coolness in his eyes, and it felt as if a warm current was infused into his body, flowing through his meridians.\n　　\"Drawing talismans in mid-air, drawing what?\" Li Ye looked at the blood-red text before his eyes, very puzzled.\n　　Without thinking about it further, Li Ye then closed his eyes and, following the blood-red text's prompt, began to use his Clairvoyant Eye to look outwards.\n　　And with this look, the scene before his eyes made his whole body tremble. He saw that under the city's dim lights, countless ghosts were wandering and lingering. But most of these ghosts were unconscious, posing no threat to ordinary people.\n　　\"Has the Underworld collapsed? So many ghosts wandering in the human realm.\" Seeing the dense mass of ghosts before his eyes, Li Ye felt his scalp go numb and immediately closed his Clairvoyant Eye.\n　　\"Anyway, I now have the ability to protect myself. The world is vast, but sleeping is paramount.\" Thinking to himself, Li Ye then collapsed into a deep sleep.\n　　A shimmering light floated within the jade pendant. Ling Yun, dressed in a white gown, stood by the bed, silently watching Li Ye.\n　　\"So carefree. The room door is gone, yet he can still sleep so soundly.\" Afterwards, she waved her sleeve and placed a restriction at the doorway.\n　　Then, with light steps, she sat down by the bed, a gentle smile appearing on her face as she looked at him.\n　　The sky gradually brightened. The oppressive atmosphere of the night was gone from the entire city. The sunlight dispelled the darkness in every corner of the city.\n　　\"Who did it, this\n「是誰幹的。」一聲巨大的喊叫聲讓李夜瞬間驚醒。\n　　揉了揉眼睛，迅速穿衣下床。\n　　「哎~該來的還是要來。」心裡嘆口氣，就朝著門外走去。\n　　只見一個中年油膩大叔站在李夜的出租屋門口，臉色陰沉的看著他，隨後看開口道：\n　　「好你小子，我的房子就這麼給你糟蹋的？」\n　　李夜擺出一臉無奈的表情，總不能說是昨晚有鬼怪索命時給弄壞的吧。真要這麼說，這個房東肯定就要說，鬼閒的沒事了專門來弄壞你家門來了？\n　　「賠多少錢，我認。」李夜打開手機就準備掃碼支付。\n　　「等會兒，我要去裡面看看，誰知道還給我又弄壞什麼了。」說著那房東就一隻手推開李夜向裡走去。\n　　走進出租屋內，一股清香撲鼻而來。房東臉上帶著疑惑看了一眼李夜心裡想道：\n　　「這小子昨晚帶女人過來了？門都弄壞了，挺猛啊。」\n　　本就破舊而且散發著淡淡腐朽味道的屋內突然有令人陶醉的清香，很難不讓人產生聯想。\n　　大約在屋內檢查了一番，這時桌子上的玉佩引起了房東的注意。\n　　走上前去順手就拿起了那玉佩，仔細打量了一下。\n　　「喂，別動我東西。」李夜看到房東拿起自己的玉佩，便快速衝上前去想要一把奪回來。\n　　房東下意識的\nHe looked towards Li Ye, at this moment the jade pendant flashed with white light, and an intense burning sensation attacked from the landlord's hand.\n　　\"Ouch,\" he lightly cried, and the jade pendant detached from his hand. Li Ye quickly stepped forward at this moment and caught the jade pendant, then hastily hung it close to his chest.\n　　Looking at his reddened palm that had been scalded, the landlord frowned deeply, looking at Li Ye.\n　　\"What kind of thing is this? It's quite a rare item. But where did you, a poor student, get this jade pendant?\"\n　　Facing the landlord's insistent questioning, Li Ye gave an awkward smile and said:\n　　\"It's just a street stall item, bought for fun. I'll pay whatever I should for this door.\"\n　　\"Alright, then pay a thousand,\" the landlord said, shaking his scalded red hand.\n　　\"A broken door actually costs me a thousand, why doesn't he just go rob someone?\" Li Ye inwardly cursed the landlord.\n　　\"Isn't that a bit expensive? This door was already broken.\" Before Li Ye could finish speaking, the landlord said casually:\n　　\"It's fine if you don't pay, just go live somewhere else. My place is the cheapest rental in the entire Jiangyin City. If you really can't afford it, then you can use your jade pendant as collateral.\"\n　　Li Ye tried his best to control his emotions, because it truly wouldn't benefit him to completely fall out with this landlord now, and what he said was also true; the rent in other places was nothing compared to this thousand yuan.\n　　\"A thousand it is then,\" Li Ye said, gritting his back teeth.\n　　After saying that, Li Ye took out his phone and paid one thousand yuan. At this moment, the landlord revealed a smug smile and said: \"Don't worry, I'll find a door for you and have it installed today, so you won't freeze.\n\"it is.\" Saying that, he waved his hand and walked out of the rented house.\n　　Seeing the landlord walk away, Li Ye secretly swore to himself that he must buy his own house in Jiangyin City.\n\n　　Just then, a phone ringtone interrupted his thoughts. He pressed the answer button and heard a loud voice from the phone: \"Hey Li Ye, wanna go to the bar tonight to have some fun?\"\n　　This person was Li Ye's university roommate, Chen Liang. Coming from a decent family, he was naturally fond of fun, and now that summer vacation had just started, he planned to go out and entertain himself.\n\n　　\"Didn't you see yesterday's news? Strange things have been happening these past few days.\"\n　　\"It's fine, it's fine, no big deal. We're going to Linghai Bar,\"\n\n　　Just as Li Ye was about to refuse Chen Liang's suggestion, a line of bloody characters floated before Li Ye's eyes again.\n　　\"Go to Linghai Bar tonight and kill the Painted Skin Ghost.\"\n　　Seeing the prompt of these bloody characters, Li Ye no longer hesitated, \"Okay, come pick me up tonight.\"\n\n　　Putting away his phone, Li Ye took out the jade pendant hanging on his chest.\n　　\"I'm counting on you tonight.\"\n　　The jade pendant seemed to respond by flashing twice.\n\n　　Soon it was evening. Chen Liang drove to Li Ye's residence, where Li Ye had already been waiting downstairs for a long time.\n　　\"Get in, let's go, someone's waiting over there.\" Chen Liang said, waving at Li Ye to signal him to get into the car.\n\n　　After getting in the car, Chen Liang stepped on the accelerator, and the engine roared loudly.\n　　\"My new car's got power, right?\" Chen Liang said with a triumphant smile.\n　　\"Slow down, slow down.\"\nThe two drove from this sparsely lit suburb towards the bustling city center. Leaning against the car window, Li Ye looked at the sky in the distance, shrouded in darkness, feeling a faint sense of unease in his heart. But this strange feeling was quickly dispelled by the warmth emanating from the jade pendant.\n　　Gradually, the surrounding buildings became more modern, with tall buildings and skyscrapers standing in abundance. Even at 12 AM, the city lights remained sleepless.\n　　Soon they arrived at the entrance of the bar. The two opened the doors and got out of the car. At the bar entrance, there stood three men and two women. A fashionably dressed young man, upon seeing Chen Liang, quickly said:\n　　\"What took you so long? Hurry and come in.\" After saying that, the young man put his arm around the scantily clad woman next to him and walked inside.\n　　Chen Liang gestured to Li Ye, and the two then walked into the bar.\n　　This was Li Ye's first time coming to such a place: noisy and rhythmic music, and scantily clad women dancing hot dances, posturing flirtatiously.\n　　Li Ye, a country bumpkin, had never seen such a scene, and instantly, his face felt slightly hot.\n　　Chen Liang patted Li Ye's shoulder and said, \"Relax, bro, I'm just taking you to see the world today.\" After saying that, he led Li Ye towards the three men and two women in front.\n　　Afterwards, the group sat down at their reserved spot. At this moment, Ling Yun's voice rang out in Li Ye's mind.\n　　\"Husband, I sense a ghostly aura here.\"\n　　\"Ghostly aura?\" Hearing Ling Yun's words, Li Ye looked around.\n　　Ling Yun immediately continued: \"Mm, I'm afraid there's a ghost transformed into an ordinary person here.\""

      "content": "Hearing Ling Yun's reminder, Li Ye immediately activated his Spirit Eye and looked around.\n　　Just as Li Ye was observing with intense concentration, Chen Liang called out to Li Ye.\n　　\"Hey, which beauty caught your eye? You're looking so engrossed.\"\n　　Li Ye subconsciously looked at Chen Liang, a look of embarrassment on his face.\n　　At this moment, a long-haired beauty wearing a short skirt, who was holding Chen Liang's hand, caught Li Ye's attention. To Li Ye, that long-haired woman was actually emitting a faint black aura from her body.\n　　This made Li Ye's expression change instantly, and he scrutinized the woman with a wary look.\n　　After seeing Li Ye's expression, Chen Liang whispered in his ear, \"What's up? Do you like this kind? I'll let you have her in a bit.\"\n　　As soon as Li Ye heard this, he gave an awkward smile and said, \"Then I'll trouble you, brother.\"\n　　\"You're usually so serious, kid. I didn't expect your true nature to be exposed the first time you come to this place.\" Chen Liang said, looking at Li Ye with an amused smile.\n　　He then patted Li Ye's shoulder and walked over to the long-haired woman, whispering something to her, making her burst into laughter, and occasionally she would look towards Li Ye.\n　　Li Ye smiled and nodded back at the long-haired woman, then muttered inwardly, \"Good brother, I'm actually helping you, otherwise you'd be sucked dry of your essence by this female ghost.\"\n　　At this moment, the long-haired woman swayed her graceful waist as she walked towards Li Ye.\n　　\"Ling Yun, is this the one? Will she discover you?\" Li Ye said to Ling Yun in his mind.\n　　\"Mm, it's this one. Rest assured, she won't discover you. She should take you to a deserted place.\"\n　　Long-haired\nThe woman sat beside Li Ye, and leaned gently against Li Ye's body.\n　　Looking at the gully formed by the pristine white buns beside him, Li Ye couldn't help but take a deep breath and lightly coughed twice.\n　　The woman looked at Li Ye's uncomfortable expression and chuckled, saying: \"Little brother, could it be that you're still a virgin?\"\n　　The woman could guess it from Li Ye's expression, then she playfully brushed Li Ye's face with her finger twice and said:\n　　\"That's even better, little brother, how about older sister takes you to a nice place in a bit?\"\n　　Li Ye didn't know how to respond at this moment, recalling how Chen Liang chatted with women, he then pretended and said: \"Alright, then I'll trouble you, older sister.\"\n　　As he spoke, he slowly put his arm around the woman's waist.\n　　\"Hmph, I'll kill you in a bit.\" At this moment, Ling Yun's furious voice rang in Li Ye's mind.\n　　Before long, he followed the woman to an empty alley behind the bar, where there was only dim light.\n　　The woman stopped and leaned against Li Ye's chest, a pair of slender hands tracing up and down Li Ye's chest.\n　　At this moment, a pair of slender, jade-like hands suddenly transformed into sharp claws covered in thorns. Just as the female ghost was about to pierce Li Ye's heart, the jade pendant on Li Ye's chest emitted a wave of white light, instantly scorching the female ghost's sharp claws.\n　　The female ghost had no time to react at all, and with a pained shriek, swiftly retreated backward.\n　　A wisp of white light slowly emanated from the jade pendant at this moment, and Ling Yun, dressed in a long white dress, slowly materialized beside Li Ye.\n　　The long-haired female ghost, who had attempted the sneak attack, now fully revealed\nrevealed her true appearance, her whole body emitting black gas, a pair of eyes without whites fiercely staring at Ling Yun.\n　　\"Hmph, a mere remnant soul dares to ambush me, watch me utterly destroy your spirit and form.\" After saying that, the female ghost floated up, and immediately black gas surrounded her. In an instant, a ball of black gas condensed and shot towards Ling Yun.\n　　At this moment, Ling Yun stood in front of Li Ye, her delicate brows slightly furrowed, waving her sleeve, a tremendous demonic power shattered that ball of black gas.\n　　Immediately, Ling Yun's figure flashed and she flew into the air, instantly arriving behind the female ghost. Her hands condensed a long sword formed from a white phantom, stabbing towards the female ghost's back.\n　　The female ghost's expression was first startled, but her reaction was swift. She turned around and used her black sharp claws to block Ling Yun's long sword.\n　　But that long sword was immensely powerful, shaking the female ghost several meters backward.\n　　Ling Yun did not give the female ghost the slightest chance to catch her breath, immediately holding the sword and stabbing towards the female ghost.\n　　This long sword formed from a white phantom emitted a spiritual energy aura. The female ghost looked at Ling Yun warily, fundamentally daring not to confront her head-on, she could only flash and dodge like a ghost.\n　　Facing the female ghost's agile dodging, Ling Yun, holding the long sword, rotated her body in place once, and a circle of white sword energy surged outwards.\n　　A pained scream rang out. One of the female ghost's arms was directly severed by that sword energy. The severed arm, emitting black gas, fell to the ground.\n　　The female ghost clutched her wound which was emitting black gas. This female ghost now finally understood, this in front of her was no ordinary remnant soul. Her gaze was wary as she looked at Ling Yun.\n　　\"It's\nI, a mere nobody, was blind to your greatness and offended you. I only beg you to spare me. You and I are both ghostly beings, why help humans? We are the same kind.\" At this moment, the female ghost pleaded for mercy, her voice surprisingly tinged with a whimper.\n　　Meanwhile, Ling Yun's face was like frost, her eyes coldly staring at her.\n　　Without a moment's hesitation, the hand holding the sword exerted force, spirit energy immediately surged forth, directly chopping towards the female ghost's head.\n　　The female ghost realized her plea for mercy was completely useless, then she let out a cold snort, and said in a low voice: \"You forced my hand. Let's all die together.\"\n　　With that, the female ghost's face became covered with black blood vessels, and then instantly turned blood-red. Her eyes filled with blood-red, and then she let out a tragic roar.\n　　\"Let's all die together!\" The female ghost's furious roar reverberated outwards.\n　　Ling Yun noticed something was wrong, and quickly stopped her movement, turning to float towards Li Ye. Arriving in front of Li Ye, she quickly formed a protective shield made of condensed spirit energy, protecting herself and Li Ye.\n　　At this moment, the female ghost's body began to emit blood-red mist from the inside out; that blood-red mist grew thicker and thicker. Then a bursting sound was heard, and the female ghost's form violently dispersed. The blood mist instantly formed countless sharp spikes that spread out in all directions.\n　　Under Ling Yun's gathered protective shield, the blood-formed spikes were blocked one by one. However, at this moment, Ling Yun's expression began to show some strain; fortunately, the number of these blood-red spikes was not large.\n　　Soon, all the spikes dissipated, and Ling Yun finally could not hold on any longer, her body falling backward, while Li Ye quickly reached out to support her, pulling her into his\ninto his embrace.\n　　\"Lingyun, what's wrong?\" Li Ye asked with concern.\n　　At this moment, Lingyun's face was pale, and she looked very weak.\n　　\"I'm fine, just a little tired.\" As soon as Lingyun's weak voice fell, her body then transformed into a white light and re-entered the jade pendant.\n　　Li Ye's face showed worry at this moment, and he looked again at the place where the female ghost exploded. At this moment, there was only a puddle of thick black liquid there. What Li Ye didn't notice was that a drop of pure black liquid from that puddle quietly merged into Li Ye's body.\n　　\"Tsk tsk tsk, with a wife like this, what more could a man ask for?\" A magnetic and youthful voice sounded in Li Ye's ear.\n　　\"Who, who's speaking?\" Li Ye looked around vigilantly.\n　　\"Kid, stop looking around, I'm inside your body.\" The voice sounded again.\n　　Hearing the voice say it was inside his body, Li Ye immediately became nervous. \"Inside my body? Who are you? Are you a demon or a ghost?\"\n　　\"Hey, kid, how do you talk like that? This Venerable One is... never mind, I won't tell you for now. You should quickly restore your wife's spiritual power. Although that Painted Skin Ghost's dying blow wasn't fatal, it still caused quite a bit of harm to the demon soul.\"\n　　At this moment, Li Ye remembered the hint given to him by the bloody characters, that his own essence blood could help the demon soul recover its spiritual power.\n　　\"I'll help you recover right now.\" Li Ye softly said to Lingyun in the jade pendant, his eyes filled with determination."

      "content": "Thinking of this, Li Ye turned and ran into the bar.\nAnd at this moment, in a dark spot in the bar's back alley, a middle-aged man dressed in black with a noticeable burn scar on his face silently watched Li Ye.\n\"Chen Liang, do you have a small knife?\" Li Ye asked anxiously, his face full of urgency.\n\"No way, it's over so quickly? Where's that woman?\" Chen Liang said with a puzzled expression.\n\"Quick, I need it urgently.\" At this moment, Li Ye dared not delay; he just wanted to know if Lingyun was alright.\n\"Don't worry, don't worry, I have one.\" With that said, Chen Liang fished out a folding knife from his pants pocket.\nLi Ye didn't say much, snatching it from Chen Liang's hand.\n\"Thanks, you go ahead and play, I'll be back in a bit.\" After speaking to Chen Liang, Li Ye turned and quickly ran to a restroom stall.\nChen Liang shook his head, smiling and muttering to himself, \"Seriously, still so strange.\" With that, he continued holding his wine glass, looking for beautiful women he could flirt with.\nArriving at the restroom, he locked the stall door and took out the jade pendant from his chest.\n\"Lingyun? Lingyun?\" Li Ye first lightly called out to Lingyun, but the jade pendant had no response whatsoever.\nNext, Li Ye gripped the jade pendant in his left hand, holding the folding knife in his right hand, and cut towards his own palm.\nGritting his molars, Li Ye's eyebrows knitted together at this moment.\nOne could see a cut of approximately one centimeter in Li Ye's palm; fresh blood instantly gushed out and flowed into the jade pendant.\nAt this moment, this jade pendant seemed to have a huge attraction, as the blood from Li Ye's wound was absorbed into the jade pendant.\n\"Hiss~\" Li Ye\nAt this moment, he felt a pang of pain, and cold sweat had already broken out on his forehead, but he still gritted his teeth and did not stop letting the jade pendant continue to absorb blood.\nAfter more than ten seconds, the jade pendant finally stopped absorbing blood. At this moment, Li Ye breathed a sigh of relief as if relieved of a heavy burden.\n\"Ling Yun, are you feeling better?\" Li Ye softly called out again.\nAt this moment, the jade pendant once again emitted a white light, and then Ling Yun's gentle and weak voice came:\n\"Mm, thank you, my lord. This humble one needs to sleep for a while.\"\n\"It's good that you're okay, you rest well.\"\nAs soon as Ling Yun's voice fell, a faint white light floated towards Li Ye's wound. Li Ye immediately felt a wave of coolness coming from the wound, and then the wound no longer bled outwards, and the wound's crack also showed a tendency to heal.\nLi Ye looked at his wound in surprise, then touched the jade pendant and thought to himself: \"Why are you so good to me? From now on, without absolute certainty, I won't let you rashly attack. I also must quickly gain a certain level of strength.\"\n\"Sigh~ I didn't expect that right after waking up, I'd have to be fed 'dog food'.\" The male within the body said dejectedly,\nAt this moment, Li Ye asked the man within his body: \"Were the blood characters I could see written by you?\"\n\"Oh, not stupid at all, it is indeed this Seat.\"\n\"I don't care what your purpose is. Since you can give me the ability to draw talismans in mid-air and a psychic eye, you presumably need me very much, and I only have one request.\"\n\"Mm-hmm-hmm, you speak and this Seat shall listen.\"\n\"Make me strong.\" Li Ye said in a firm tone.\n\"To make you strong, but\nAlright, but you have to help me complete a few things in exchange.\"\n　　\"As long as it's not something wicked, I promise you.\"\n　　\"Don't worry, This Seat is very principled. I haven't thought of the things yet; wait until you get home, I'll give you something good then.\"\n　　After finishing the conversation with his inner self, Li Ye then left the restroom.\n　　At this moment, Chen Liang was chatting up a beautiful woman dressed revealingly, but that beautiful woman seemed to get angry and picked up her drink and splashed it onto Chen Liang's face, then picked up her handbag and left.\n　　Li Ye, standing not far from Chen Liang, seeing this scene, immediately looked completely embarrassed; just as he was about to call out to him, he stopped himself from speaking.\n　　Chen Liang closed his eyes and wiped the drink off his face with his hand, glaring fiercely in the direction the woman left.\n　　\"Hmph, if you're not going, then don't go, what's with the act?\"\n　　Just then, Chen Liang noticed Li Ye standing behind him, looking at Li Ye with a dispirited expression out of the corner of his eye, he said: \"You brat, you had a good time today, didn't you?\"\n　　\"Uh... it's alright, it's alright.\" Li Ye laughed awkwardly.\n　　With that said, Chen Liang downed the rest of the wine in his glass in one gulp.\n　　\"Alright, then today we've achieved half our goal. Let's go home, no more playing.\" He stretched, and Chen Liang's arm hooked around Li Ye's neck as they walked out.\n　　\"Here's your knife.\" Li Ye handed the folding knife to Chen Liang.\n　　\"Since you needed it so badly, I'll just give it to you.\" After Chen Liang finished speaking, he started the car and floored the gas pedal, leaving the bar entrance.\n　　Soon, Chen Liang dropped Li Ye off at his doorstep,\n　　\"Today's outing didn't start well, another day...\n「再約。」說罷就開車揚長而去。\n　　李夜露出微笑搖了搖頭，隨後返回家中。\n　　「相公快回去，我感覺附近有東西。」此時李夜的腦海裡傳來了靈雲的聲音。\n　　對於靈雲的話李夜沒有半分懷疑，立馬加快腳步跑回家中。\n　　「剛才有什麼東西在附近？」李夜緊張的問道。\n　　伴隨著靈雲那悅耳的笑聲，一道白光從玉佩中傳出，靈雲婀娜的身姿慢慢浮現。\n　　而她此刻正捂著嘴輕聲笑著說道：「逗相公玩呢，附近只有些孤魂野鬼罷了。」\n　　聽到靈雲的話，李夜此刻表情頓時尷尬起來。\n　　「沒有就好，你剛恢復沒多久。真要有我是真的擔心。」李夜頓時鬆口氣說道。\n　　「相公，你的手怎麼樣了。」說著靈雲緩步上前，拉起李夜受傷的手看了起來。\n　　「沒事了，好的差不多了。對了有個問題我想問你。」\n　　說罷李夜拉著靈雲坐在床邊，靈雲雙手放在腿上端坐著，一臉溫柔的看著李夜。\n　　「相公且問便是。」靈雲說道。\n　　李夜撓著頭思考著，緊接著說道：「emm...咱兩以前是不是認識？」\n　　聽到李夜的詢問靈雲明顯愣了一下，眼神瞬間閃躲看向地面。\n　　「要不你那天晚上為啥會救我。」李夜緊接著說道。\n　　「奴家...奴\nI have known my husband since a very long time ago. But there are some things this servant cannot say yet.\" Ling Yun lightly bit her lip, her hands tightly clutching her skirt.\n　　Li Ye saw Ling Yun's difficulty, and so he did not press further.\n　　He just gave an awkward smile and said: \"It's nothing, I was just asking. It's getting late, I'll go to sleep soon.\"\n　　\"Mm, husband, rest early.\" Ling Yun nodded slightly, and then transformed into a wisp of white mist and drilled into the jade pendant.\n　　\"It seems Ling Yun and I definitely have some connection, otherwise why would she call me husband?\"\n　　After pondering in his heart, Li Ye asked the man inside him: \"Hey, what are you going to give me?\"\n　　\"Damn it, can you stop always calling me 'hey'? Call me Lord Dao Gui.\"\n　　Li Ye immediately felt helpless, and could only call out again: \"Yes, Lord Dao Gui, may I ask what Lord Dao Gui is going to bestow upon me?\"\n　　\"Don't worry, I won't mistreat you.\"\n　　As soon as his voice fell, a small ball of blood mist floated before Li Ye, gradually revealing a book that glowed with a faint light throughout its body. Seeing the cover of this book, Li Ye felt that it was no ordinary item.\n　　\"Daoist Talismans Compendium, sounds quite powerful.\"\n　　He saw the title written in inlaid gold, the entirely black cover felt very textured to the touch, Li Ye licked his fingers, and then impatiently began to flip through it.\n　　Opening the book, a dazzling array of talisman names and drawing methods appeared in his eyes from the table of contents.\n　　\"Edict to Exterminate Evil Talisman, Evil Suppressing Talisman, Five Thunder Talisman, Fire Talisman Spell, Corpse Fixing Talisman...\" Looking at the types of talismans in the book, Li Ye murmured to himself.\nAmong the many talismans inside, Li Ye only recognized the Corpse-Fixing Talisman. After all, he grew up watching Lam Ching-ying's zombie movies, so he was more than familiar with this kind of talisman that could make zombies stand still. At this moment, the last part of the book caught Li Ye's attention.\n\n『Still serializing...』\nFor more e-books, please visit Aixia Ebooks, Traditional Chinese: https://ixdzs8.tw; Simplified Chinese: https://ixdzs8.com"
